\section{Introduction}
Recent elections in the western world have seen what can only be described as an anti-immigrant sentiment that is protruding its teeth at all who oppose it. Indeed, also in the UK one can see the rise of parties that advertise a curbing of the migrant flow and rethinking our policies on asylum as well as visa restrictions. A disadvantage of relying on news media and political figures for accurate information is the lack of readily available sources on the matter at one's disposal. Think of when was the last time that you saw a newspaper article stating a claim, and then failing to provide any links to where those particular numbers came from. Thus is the motivation for this paper. In it, we will attempt to show how one can use publicly available data on immigration figures to visualise information in a user friendly tool, that allows for exploration and the gathering of your own insights with regards to the immigration debate.

\section{Dataset Selection}
For this project, we choose to use three publicly available datasets from the UK government regarding immigration. The covered topics will include the people who move to the UK, those applying for asylum and the outcome of the decisions for or against them, the number of detentions in the UK of foreign people, as well as those who apply for UK citizenship or settled status. The data spans a time period from 2017 all the way back to 2004 so that we may observe changes in trends over time. The datasets available only represent quarterly statistics, but through the combination of many datasets and due to the extended time period available to work with, a rich enough analysis can still be completed. In short, there are many datasets available with which we can build a very useful and rich tool. The full datasets are available at the links listed in [1] [2].
